WARN: DRMG-MCSCF orbitals are not natural orbitals in active space. It's recommended
to rerun DMRG-CASCI with mc.natorb before calling DMRG-NEVPT2.

WARN: DMRG executable file for nevptsolver is the same to the executable file for DMRG solver. If they are both compiled by MPI compilers, they may cause error or random results in DMRG-NEVPT calculation.
